             <h2>IDEA</h2>
             <p>Zaar is the online thrift store for college students to easily and safely exchange used goods. My co-founder and I came up with the idea for Zaar while seniors at Brown University. While moving into our respective apartments, we were frustrated by the  process of trying to buy and sell items from other students on campus. People our age used Facebook groups or Instagram accounts to list things they were selling. However, it was difficult to find what we wanted by scrolling through Facebook posts, and we had to put a lot of effort into making pretty Google Slides presentations to sell what we no longer wanted. We envisioned a platform that made it super easy to buy and sell on campus.</p> 
             <p>My role was to spearhead the product design process. I started with the research phase, which consisted of an in-depth analysis of competing and/or similar secondhand marketplace platforms, as well as extensive user interviews to gauge whether students like us actually resonated with the idea. I then created user personas and simple wireframes before developing mockups and clickable prototypes. In total, it took about a month from research to conception to create an MVP of Zaar. The site is currently live and the company is in its pre-seed stage.</p>

            <h2>COMPETITION ANALYSIS</h2>
            <p>I wanted a thorough understanding of how competing platforms approached the secondhand buying/selling process. Students I interviewed never used Craigslist due to fears of transacting with strangers, rarely used eBay and Facebook marketplace, sometimes used apps like Depop and Poshmark, and mostly used Facebook groups to sell their used items online. Therefore, I focused my competitor analysis on Facebook groups and platforms like Depop and Poshmark. However, students didn't like to pay for shipping on these platforms and complained about the lack of search and filter features within Facebook groups. Depop was by far the most popular non-Facebook secondhand marketplace app. Students felt confident that they could find "cool" items on the app, and they liked how easy it was to scroll through items using Depop's Instagram-esque interface.</p>

                <h2>USER INTERVIEWS</h2>
                <p>Next, I went through the process of interviewing potential users (college students) in order to grasp their pain points and understand what they valued most when buying and selling used items online. This initial user interview process yielded four main insights: </p>
            </div>
            <div class="interview-card">
                <p>1. Students value buying and selling with people they trust</p>
                <p>Students aged 18 to 24 - especially female students - feel very uncomfortable transacting online with strangers. Therefore, they rarely if ever use platforms like Craigslist or Facebook Marketplace, because these platforms are populated by people they don't know. Students I interviewed gravitated more towards "young" and "cool" apps like Depop for buying and selling, although they didn't like the costs associated with shipping on those types of platforms. Instead, most students made Facebook groups or used Instagram accounts to sell items exclusively within their college community or trusted group of friends. </p>
                <q>"In a Facebook group, I know who I'm buying from. I would definitely trust students from my college over people on Craigslist."</q>
            </div>
            <div class="interview-card">
                <p>2. Students value ease and efficiency when buying and selling</p>
                <p>Students really like the efficiency and ease of buying from people who live nearby. They don't mind walking to pick up an item they've bought, as long as they are buying from another student or friend, and therefore feel reasonably comfortable going to the seller's house. </p>
                <q>"Facebook is convenient and local; picking up items nearby is easy."</q>
            </div>
            <div class="interview-card">
                <p>3. Facebook is hard to use for buying and selling because it lacks key features</p>
                <p>Students want to search through social media to find what they're looking to buy, but Facebook groups and Instagram lack the ability to search. Students expressed annoyance at having to scroll endlessly to find a specific thing they were looking for or having to wait for someone to upload what they wanted.</p>
                <q>"Searching for something I want in a Facebook group is impossible. I have to scroll through and open a bunch of Google Slides presentations if I want to find something I need."</q>
            </div>
            <div class="interview-card" style="margin-bottom: 60px">
                <p>4. Students would prefer to shop secondhand because it's cheaper</p>
                <p>College students have a great need for shopping secondhand online because they are cost-conscious and highly transitory. Because they have to move every year, they either have to pay high costs to store their things or find other students who want them; otherwise, their unused or unwanted items end up in the dumpster.</p>

        <div class="wireframe">
            <div class="regular-block-text" style="margin-bottom: 0px">
                <h2>WIREFRAMING & PROTOTYPING</h2>
                <p>I now felt ready to develop a basic wireframe of the Zaar website and, from there, to design a prototype. My co-founder and I decided it would be easiest to design and build an MVP of the site in lieu of a clickable prototype, then conduct usability testing and iterate on the design of the site from there.</p>
