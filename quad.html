            <h2>IDEA</h2>
            <p>The Quad is an app to help young professionals and entrepreneurs find and connect with "cool" people. When I talked with the co-founders initially, they expressed how frustrating it had been for them - young people in the financial industry - to connect with and meet new friends online when they had moved to new cities. They both loved entrepreneurship, they said, and had met many people who were either looking for cool co-founders or people with similar interests in the places to which they moved. They also said it was hard to meet new people on platforms like Facebook and Instagram, which were designed to help you connect with people you had already met. </p> 
            <p>The vision for The Quad was that it be a hybrid between a blind dating app and LinkedIn - essentially a way to find people with whom who you connected and progressively establish a relationship with them. The co-founders had already done user interviews and created a detailed information architecture for how the app should function by our first meeting. From their research and my own, I was able to create a full mobile app design.</p>
