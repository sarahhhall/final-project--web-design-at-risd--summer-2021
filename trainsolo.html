            <h2>IDEA</h2>
            <p>Trainsolo is a fitness app helping soccer athletes stay on top of their training while at home. The target users are athletes aged 15-25 (high school and college athletes) seeking a way to customize their workouts to meet their individual training demands. The app includes a "Generate your own Training Program" feature, which allows users to tailor their workouts according to skill, position, and length. It also allows college athletes to look up their individual school's training regimens and add those workouts to their dashboard. The company is currently in its pre-revenue stage.</p>

        <h2>THE BRIEF</h2>
        <p>The Trainsolo founder was looking for an app redesign. He had already created wireframes and conducted initial user interviews to ascertain athletes' pain points and values regarding at-home training. Using these insights, I was able to make suggestions to improve the intuitiveness of the wireframes. I then created a series of sample mockups of the product's MVP. </p>
