            <h2>THE BRIEF</h2>
            <p>Rhymes with Reason is an Ed-tech startup aimed at improving literacy learning for elementary and middle school kids by teaching them vocabulary through the lyrics of their favorite musical artists. I was hired to redesign the Rhymes with Reason website at a stage when the company was experiencing more traction and therefore wanted a visual refresh.</p> 
            <p>Although some aspects of the sitemap needed reworking to be more intuitive for teachers and parents visiting the site, the majority of my work was spent translating the company's brand into a cohesive visual style that balanced fun and seriousness.</p>

        <h2>VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
        <p>Redesigning Rhymes with Reason's website was a fun challenge because the company's end users are polar opposites. On one hand, RWR caters to educators and school administrators, who are purchasing a service and therefore want to feel assured that the company will provide a quality learning tool. On the other hand, the people actually using the learning tool are the students themselves - typically middle schoolers from inner-city schools who want an immersive educational experience that speaks their language. </p>  
        <p>With both these end users in mind, I endeavored to create a website design that balanced seriousness and levity. Rhymes with Reason's brand is inherently bright and fun due to its color pairing of lime green and watermelon pink. Adding this visual flavor in small doses to the site allowed it to speak to the students, while incorporating minimalistic elements and photographs of kids using the product catered visually to the educators and parents who use the site.</p>
